 * Unified "a run was just created, what happens next?" entrypoint.

 *   self_hosted → leaves the run in `pending` for local Claude Code to claim
 *                 via the MCP `runs_claim` tool, and records an audit entry
 *                 so the UI can reflect "queued for local Claude".
 *
 * Callers do not need to know which mode they're in — this helper is the
 * single place that branches.
