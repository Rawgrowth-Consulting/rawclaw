 * Maps our internal integration ids (from integrations-catalog.ts) to

 *
 * Keeping this separate from the catalog means we can evolve the two
 * independently — the catalog describes the *product surface* (brand,
 * description, which auth methods are available), and this map is the
 * runtime wiring to Nango.
 *
 * When adding a new integration:
 *  1. Create a provider config in Nango dashboard (give it any key).
 *  2. Add the key here mapped to the catalog integration id.
 *  3. (If OAuth) Paste your provider OAuth app's client id/secret
 *     into the Nango config.
