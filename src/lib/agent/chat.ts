/**
 * CLI runtime path for chatReply (RUNTIME_PATH=cli).
 *
 * Anthropic's Feb-2026 ToS change made Claude Max OAuth tokens
 * (sk-ant-oat01-*) valid ONLY through the Claude Code CLI - raw
 * /v1/messages calls with the oauth-2025-04-20 beta now get soft-429'd.
 * On cli-mode VPSes (OAuth-only, NO commercial API key) chatReply must
 * therefore generate via the `claude` CLI subprocess instead of the raw
 * fetch.
 *
 * This mirrors `generateViaClaudeCli` in lib/runs/executor.ts: same
 * `claude --print --dangerously-skip-permissions` invocation, same
 * HOME=/home/node so the CLI finds the host's ~/.claude credentials,
 * same `--mcp-config` temp-file wiring of the org's Rawgrowth MCP
 * server, same stdout read, same wall-clock abort. The executor's copy
 * is NOT exported, so the spawn logic is replicated here rather than
 * imported - a future refactor could lift this into a shared helper
 * (e.g. lib/llm/claude-cli.ts) and have both call sites use it.
 *
 * Returns the trimmed stdout on success. Throws on spawn error, non-zero
 * exit, or abort - chatReply catches and falls back to the raw API path
 * so a broken CLI doesn't take chat down entirely.
 *
 * The system prompt + user message handed in are EXACTLY what the raw
 * /v1/messages path would have sent (system = CLAUDE_CODE_PREFIX, user =
 * persona-and-instructions preamble + the inbound message), so persona /
 * preamble / handoff-sentinel behaviour is identical across both paths.

  // oauth-2025-04-20 beta now get soft-429'd. cli-mode VPSes (e.g.
  // Marti's - OAuth-only, NO commercial API key) must therefore generate
  // via the `claude` subprocess, the same way the routine executor does
  // (generateViaClaudeCli in lib/runs/executor.ts).
  //
  // The CLI gets EXACTLY the system + user message the raw path would
  // have sent: system = CLAUDE_CODE_PREFIX, user = the persona-and-
  // instructions preamble + the inbound message (firstUserContent). So
  // persona / preamble / CHAT_HANDOFF_SENTINEL behaviour is byte-for-byte
  // identical across both paths - only the transport differs.
  //
  // Conversation history: the raw path passes prior turns as separate
  // `messages` entries. --print is single-shot, so prior turns are folded
  // into the user message as a transcript block ahead of the preamble.
  //
  // If the CLI spawn fails / times out / exits non-zero / returns empty,
  // we DO NOT return an error - we fall through to the raw /v1/messages
  // pool walk below, so a broken CLI degrades to the old behaviour rather
  // than taking chat down entirely.
