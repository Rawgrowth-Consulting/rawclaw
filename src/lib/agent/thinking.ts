/**
 * Reasoning-trace extraction.
 *
 * Agents are instructed by the REASONING PROTOCOL block in preamble.ts to
 * open every reply with a <thinking>...</thinking> block - the ReAct
 * "Thought" step: the same model that writes the answer first states its
 * real plan for the turn (what the operator wants, delegate-or-answer, why).
 *
 * This module pulls that block back out so the surfaces can:
 *   - strip it from the operator-visible reply (it must never render raw),
 *   - surface it as a separate "thinking" trace line (dashboard SSE event /
 *     Telegram italic prefix / rgaios_audit_log row for /trace).
 *
 * It is the response-side equivalent of the old pre-reply Haiku guess in
 * the chat route, except it is the agent's ACTUAL reasoning rather than a
 * separate model guessing at intent.

// HOTFIX 8 (2026-05-17, FLEX MODE OPERATOR UX): swap developer jargon
// in the operator-visible reasoning trace for plain operator language.
// R5/R9 v2 walk leaked "coercion error" / "UUID" / "lookup ambiguity"
// directly into Kasia's reasoning panel - pure implementation noise
// that the operator never needs to see. The thinking string surfaces
// in two places (chat Reasoning chip + Telegram "💭 ..." prefix) so
// the transform lives at extractThinking's boundary, not at the emit
// site, so any new caller inherits the humanization automatically.
//
// IMPORTANT: this is a display-only transform. The original reasoning
// is still persisted to rgaios_audit_log (kind chat_thinking) with the
// raw text, so /trace + the developer view keep the technical content
// for debugging. Only the operator-visible chip is rewritten.
//
// HOTFIX 15 (2026-05-17, R-BELL notification walk): the map +
// humanizeJargon now live in src/lib/agent/jargon.ts (client-safe)
// so the notification bell + other "use client" surfaces can reuse
// it without dragging in supabaseAdmin (server-only).
