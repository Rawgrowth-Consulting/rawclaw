/**
 * Default agent seed for a fresh organization.
 *
 * Each pillar (department) ships with one Manager (is_department_head=true)
 * plus one or more Sub-agents (is_department_head=false) that report to
 * the Manager. Department slug is set on both manager and sub-agents -
 * the previous bug had every default agent landing as UNASSIGNED on
 * /agents/tree and "13 agents waiting to be placed in a department" on
 * /departments because no department was being written and the head flag
 * was left default-false.
 *
 * Idempotent. Safe to call multiple times per org. Skips a manager when
 * `(organization_id, department) where is_department_head=true` already
 * has a row (the partial unique index from migration 0033). Skips a
 * sub-agent when an agent with the same (organization_id, name) exists.
 *
 * Wired from createClient() in @/lib/clients/queries so every org
 * provisioned through the admin panel lands with a fully-populated org
 * chart instead of a 13-agent dump in Unassigned.
