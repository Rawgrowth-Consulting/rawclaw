// Chris feedback 2026-05-17 FLEX MODE: agents must stop sounding like
// they are talking ABOUT the operator ("the client", "Marti's instance")
// and start talking TO them ("you / your") when the operator IS the
// owner/admin of the active org. The brand-profile injection in
// preamble.ts is the loudest leak - it always says "THIS IS THE CLIENT
// YOU WORK FOR", even when the CEO/owner themselves is the one driving
// the chat.
//
// These specs pin:
//   1. getActiveOrgRole helper exists with the documented contract.
//   2. buildAgentChatPreamble accepts userRole + threads isOwnerContext.
//   3. brand-profile string flips owner -> "Your brand profile" while
//      non-owner stays on the original "THIS IS THE CLIENT YOU WORK FOR"
//      so legacy surfaces (Telegram webhook, scheduled routines) are
//      unaffected.
//   4. chat route imports getActiveOrgRole + passes userRole through.
