install_command "rawgrowth-status" \
"Use the rawgrowth MCP server to give me a one-paragraph status update on this organization.

Specifically:
1. Call \`runs_list_pending\` to count pending routine runs.
2. Look up how many approvals are pending (use any rawgrowth tool that surfaces approvals; if none, just say so).
3. Summarize in 3-4 sentences: pending work, anything blocked, anything that needs my attention.

Be terse. Don't recite tool names. Just give me the picture.
"

install_command "rawgrowth-triage" \
"Pick up the OLDEST pending routine run from the rawgrowth MCP server and execute it end-to-end.

Steps:
1. Call \`runs_list_pending\` (limit 1) to find the oldest pending run.
2. If none, say so and stop.
3. Call \`runs_claim\` with that run_id — read the routine instructions and input payload it returns.
4. Execute the routine using the available rawgrowth MCP tools (gmail, knowledge, etc.).
5. When done, call \`runs_complete\` with a short plain-text summary.
6. If something blocks completion, call \`runs_fail\` with a clear error.

Stay scoped to a single run. Do not loop into another one without me asking.
"

install_command "rawgrowth-help" \
"List what the rawgrowth MCP server can do for this organization.

1. Call \`tools/list\` (or describe what tools the rawgrowth server exposes).
2. Group them: what reads, what writes, what's gated by approvals.
3. List any prompts (active routines).
4. End with 2-3 example commands the user could give me right now.
"

install_command "rawgrowth-chat" \
"Check my Telegram inbox via the rawgrowth MCP server and respond to every unanswered message.

Steps:
1. Call \`telegram_inbox_read\` to see unanswered messages.
2. If none, say 'Inbox zero.' and stop.
3. For each message, in order (oldest first):
   a. Understand what the user is asking for.
   b. Use the appropriate rawgrowth or native connector tools (Gmail, Slack, Drive, agents_*, routines_*, runs_*) to do the work.
   c. Call \`telegram_reply\` with that message's id and a concise, helpful response.
4. After all messages are answered, give me a one-line summary of what you handled.

Keep replies terse — Telegram, not email.
"

install_command "rawgrowth-skills-sync" \
"Install every Claude Code skill that's assigned to any agent in my rawgrowth org, skipping skills that are already installed on this laptop.

Steps:
1. Call \`agents_list\` on the rawgrowth MCP server. The response lists each agent's assigned skills and, at the bottom, a list of install commands for every unique skill.
2. For each skill in that list:
   a. Check whether \`~/.claude/skills/<skill_directory>\` already exists on this laptop using a Bash ls or stat.
   b. If it DOES exist, say '✓ <skill name> already installed' and move on.
   c. If it DOES NOT exist, run the install command exactly as given (an \`npx skills add ...\` line) using the Bash tool.
   d. After running the install, verify the directory now exists.
3. When done, give me a single-line summary: how many were already installed, how many you installed now, and any that failed.

Safety:
- Only run \`npx skills add\` commands that came directly from the MCP response. Do not guess URLs.
- If no agents have any skills assigned yet, say 'No skills to sync.' and stop.
- Never uninstall or modify existing skills.
